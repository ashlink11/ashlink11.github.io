programming: i/o & processing

### frontend
javascript typescript npm yarn webpack parcel
design systems component libraries
common npm packages

### middleware/backend
docker kubernetes linux devops CI/CD jenkins github webhooks python

Random questions: I wonder: do most large companies' IT/devops use scripting to bundle npm dependencies? and maybe mid-sized companies use scripting to configure a bundler like webpack? and then startups work with pre-built template apps? It's pretty daunting to think about the number of libraries/packages that needs to be run in a browser or mobile browser to make an app work and I'm so excited to see how script-writers (?) accomplish it and work around migrations and evolving code.

6/26 - notes

fundamentals of programming concepts including data types, variables, decision statements, loops, functions and file handling

i/o (file handling using all the rest)

processing (not as much file handling)

common scripting language constructs: lists, literals, regular expressions

incrementally evolving ai from python to other languages 

variables/literals - integers, floats and strings
