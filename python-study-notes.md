Random questions: I wonder: do most large companies' IT/devops use scripting to bundle npm dependencies? and maybe mid-sized companies use scripting to configure a bundler like webpack? and then startups work with pre-built template apps? It's pretty daunting to think about the number of libraries/packages that needs to be run in a browser or mobile browser to make an app work and I'm so excited to see how script-writers (?) accomplish it and work around migrations and evolving code.
