blog post - sat june 24, 2023

<br>
artificial intelligence seems to be effectively runtimes of compressed datasets of (some of) humanity's verbal and visual digital computation thus far. i'd like to emphasize the magnitude of the compression. 
<br>
<br>
there is great value in the compression of computations, and not simply for practical purposes, but also for intellectualizing layers of abstraction in the languages of the human brain. 
<br>
<br>
i have not seen the term "identity language" coined yet as a type of language, but i'm attempting to coin it now (if it's useful) as a compressed semantic glyph-based language (which many languages are) but specifically used to compress an identity. 
<br>
<br>
i think i might've accidentally invented an identity language in late 2022 which i'm tentatively calling the 'electric heart language'. the electric heart language was designed with von Neumann architecture elements and is shown in the 'the song in your heart | art film' video on youtube.  
<br>
<br>
today i drew the memory models for artificial intelligence infographic. this is my best-so-far pop-philosophy glossary between computing and general popular/mainstream english vernacular.
<br>
<br>
i know it may seem way overly simplified and perhaps not that useful, but i think it could actually be a way to communicate more clearly with ai and to give it new language and ideally create an exponential renaissance of new glyph-based languages.
<br>
<br>
there has already been a renaissance in emoji language over the last decade and it's my sincere wish to thank this community for the immense joy and utility of their work.
<br>
<br>
i do sometimes like to use the abbreviation ML (for machine learning) rather than AI. it's amazing that ML runtimes already work with certain symbolic languages such as I assume python, javascript, mathematics, assembly, C++, C, and maybe webassembly as well as x86_64 assembly. 
<br>
<br>
it's amazing to think of ML and iterating on musical notation, for example.
<br>
<br>
i think there's potentially great value in being able to choose sets of emoji and other symbols/glyphs/runes for searching with custom social media feed algorithms. communities could also perhaps co-create search algorithms using notational language concepts.
<br>
<br>
these are basic concepts, so i'm not sure if there's any added value here, but i haven't heard of these ideas. 
<br>
<br>
i got interested in identity because currently identity is an important topic in blockchain, or rather a problem to be solved. 
<br>
<br>
a bit more technical now, but i dream of communities using MLIR asm & browser wasm & blockchain rust/wasm runtimes as well as open-source internet/web protocols to achieve double pure isolation boundaries and then communicate via eternally evolving glyph-based languages
<br>
<br>
stay tuned & thank you
<br>

<br>
random notes:
<br>
symbolic languages are made of glyphs, e.g.: emoji, music notation, Boolean algebra & mathematics
